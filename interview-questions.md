# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is what is part of the method signature where the argument is what is passed when a calling a function or invoking. 
  
  Researched answer: While similar the difference between a parameter is variable defined in function declaration. An Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to the function when invoking or calling the function.




2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The parameters that .map and .filter takes is value,index,array. The required one would be value which is the actual value at the index in the array the optional parameters are index and array.

  Researched answer: .map and .filter both have the predefined parameters of value,index,array where value is required and the other two are optional. Worth noting that the names can be anything but order will always be that of a value, index, array. 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:

    .map will iterate through an array and returns an array of the same lengths.
    For .filter this iterates through an array and returns a modified array. 

  Researched answer: Key difference is that a .filter will iterate through an array but returns only those values that are either truthy or satisfy a certain condtion. A .map iterates through an array but returns an array of the same length. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Besides the syntax a difference is that a function is a resusable code machine while a method are associated with objects and a function is not.

  Researched answer:  Methods are functions stored as object properties where a function is created and can be called and live outside object properties.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is the process by which specific object properties can be accessed and these can be assigned to variables. 

  Researched answer: Object destructuring allows us to extract the properties we choose from objects and can then bind these properties to new variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I am not familiar with this term so I will research the answer. 

  Researched answer: Hoisiting is what allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Using the extend keyword class inheritance is what allows us to reuse properties and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

2. React: A front end library used to build user interfaces. 

3. React state: React state refers to the React object(built in) that is used to contain data or information about the component.

4. React lifecycle methods: In React every component has a lifecycle which as the developer we can monitor and manipulate during the three main phases. Known as mounting, updating, and unmounting.

5. DOM: Document Object Model is a standard for accessing documents. Is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.
